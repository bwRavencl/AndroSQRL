AndroSQRL
=========

This project aims to create an open-source SQRL-Client for Android devices. For information on SQRL itself please refer to https://www.grc.com/sqrl/sqrl.htm. This Project is loosely based on geier54's POC for an SQRL-Client (https://github.com/geir54/android-sqrl).

##Please note: This application is highly experimental at this point and should under no circumstances be used in a production environment!
